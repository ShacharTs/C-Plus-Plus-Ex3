Turn‐and‐flow control
Action out of turn
Attempt any action (e.g. tax) when it’s not that player’s turn → throws TurnError.

Skip turn without extra‐turn
Call skipTurn on a player with no extra‐turn flag → throws ActionError.

Game over stops all actions
After one player wins, any subsequent call to gather, tax, coup, etc. → throws GameOverError.

Player removal & turn order
Coup removes player from future turns
After coup(attacker, victim), getListOfTargetPlayers(attacker) never includes the victim, and nextTurn skips them.

nextTurn wraps correctly after removals
If the last‐in‐order player is eliminated, calling nextTurn still cycles back to the first active player.

Sanction & permission flags
Double-sanction disallowed
Sanction the same target twice in a row → second sanction throws SanctionError.

Gather/tax blocked by sanction
After sanction(p0,p1), any gather(p1) or tax(p1) → throws ActionError.

Sanction lifts after next turn
Verify that once play cycles back around, the target’s gather/tax flags are restored.

Special‐role abilities
General’s discounted coup
Give a General exactly 5 coins and call coup(general, target) → succeeds, leaving them at 0 coins.

Baron’s exchange
Test that baron.exchange() swaps the correct number of coins with the treasury and respects the maximum/minimum limits.

Judge’s single‐use penalty
Calling judge.bribe(victim) twice in one turn → second call throws BribeError.

Extra-turn stacking
Multiple bribes accumulate
Two successive judge.bribe(...) calls give the judge two extra-turn flags.

skipTurn consumes only one
After stacking two extra-turns, skipTurn once leaves exactly one extra-turn remaining.

Blocking behavior
Block invalid action
handleBlock(p, true, "NotAnAction", anyCost) → returns false, leaves coins & turn unchanged.

Tax block resets next‐turn permission
If someone BLOCKs your Tax, ensure your isTaxAllow() is reset and only restored after your next real turn.

Initialization & limits
Too few players
Constructing Game with only 1 or 0 names → throws InitError.

Too many players
(If you enforce a max) Constructing with >X names → throws InitError.

Coin edge-cases
Spy steal when no coins
spy.arrest(victimWithZeroCoins) → throws CoinsError.

Merchant passive on zero
A Merchant with 0 coins still gains +1 coin at the start of every turn cycle, even if they never acted.
